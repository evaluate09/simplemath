# MATH.PY - 29/06/2022
Assessment Task 2 - UTS Wanago Program

This is a program that will help with basic maths skills for 5-9 year-old (Australian New South Wales curriculum) and is especially helpful for parents or educators.
<br>*Note: You do not need an active internet connection to run the program.*

## Step by Step Guide to Installing & Running the Program

1. To start, you must download Python (preferably Python 3.10) from either the windows store or from here <br>-> https://www.python.org/downloads/. 

2. On the github file, click the green "code" button and then "download ZIP".

3. Right click on the ZIP file and extract it to a desired location.

4. Locate MATH.PY in the extracted file and right click on the file. You should then see an option to “open with” in which you are to select “open with Python 3.10” or whatever Python version you have installed. 

5. You will notice that the program has opened up and it is welcoming you! Two important things to note when using the program, however. **Do not click on the program while it is running** and **do not spam enter**. Further explanation is down below, but this is to ensure the program doesn’t break. 

6. You will be given a few questions to answer, in regards to your name, desired mode, desired question type and desired difficulty. Do not worry too much about specific formatting, the program will let you know if you have inputted something incorrectly!

7. **Make sure your choices are correct**. You do not have the option to change your decision midway through the program and if you do wish to change your choices, you must go back to the start.

8. Do the maths questions provided! If you input anything that isn’t the correct **number** (not letters), the program will mark it as incorrect so do not type in the numbers as words.

9. Receive your final score and choose to play again or exit the program. Remember, practice makes perfect!

## Known Errors & Bugs

- **Clicking the screen pauses the program** - This is a result of a windows feature known as QuickEdit. There is a way to manually turn it off as shown here <br>-> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37578529/disable-quickedit-in-windows-10-cmd-exe#:~:text=Right%20click%20on%20the%20title,with%20Defaults%20instead%20of%20Properties.&text=Perfect%2C%20thank%20you%20very%20much!&text=Right%20click%20%2D%3E%20defaults%20%2D%3E,all%20disabled%20for%20all%20cmd's
<br>Alternatively, you can just refrain from clicking on the program as no interaction with the mouse is needed

- **Pressing enter too many times breaks the program** - Although the reason for this is currently unknown, it is likely that you inputted too much. There is no fix for this other than restarting the program.
